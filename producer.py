"""
Sensor Data Event Producer

Requires Python 3.11+

This producer simulates a real-time stream of compressor sensor data events.
It reads from the provided SQLite database and publishes events into a Python queue,
simulating how data would flow through a production message system.

The stream ends with a sentinel value (None) after all database rows have been
replayed, or when stop() is called.

Usage:
    from producer import SensorEventProducer
    import queue

    q = queue.Queue()
    producer = SensorEventProducer(db_path="sensor_data.db", event_queue=q)
    producer.start()

    # Consume events from the queue
    while True:
        event = q.get()
        if event is None:  # Sentinel value signals end of stream
            break
        process(event)

You do NOT need to modify this file. Read it to understand the event format,
then build a consumer that processes these events.
